# Feature Specification: Laravel Blade Template Parser

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-laravel`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a Laravel Blade template parser that can tokenize, parse, and produce an AST for Blade template files. The parser must support the complete Blade directive syntax (@if, @foreach, @forelse, @while, @for, @switch, @include, @extends, @section, @yield, @push, @stack, @component, @slot, @props, @aware, @once, @php, @verbatim, etc.), Blade components with named slots and attributes, echo statements ({{ }}, {{{ }}}, {!! !!}), Blade comments ({{-- --}}), and Alpine.js attributes (x-data, x-show, x-if, x-model, x-bind, x-on, @click, etc.). The parser should produce a traversable AST that can be serialized to JSON, provide accurate error messages with line and column information for syntax errors, support streaming/incremental parsing for large template files, and expose both a programmatic Dart API and a CLI interface that accepts Blade files via stdin or file path and outputs the AST as JSON or a human-readable tree format. The parser must be pure Dart with no platform-specific dependencies, work in Flutter, Dart CLI, and web environments, and achieve performance of at least 1000 lines per second with memory usage under 100MB for typical templates."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: When the parser encounters syntax errors (FR-026 mentions reporting multiple errors without stopping), what should the parser's recovery strategy be? ‚Üí A: Continue parsing after errors to find all syntax issues, produce partial AST with error markers
- Q: The spec mentions "streaming/incremental parsing" (FR-029) for large files. Should the parser produce AST nodes incrementally as it reads, or parse the entire file first then stream the AST output? ‚Üí A: Support both modes: default full-parse, opt-in streaming mode for large files
- Q: For the CLI output formats (FR-034/FR-035), how should the user specify which format they want? ‚Üí A: Use command-line flags (e.g., `--json` or `--tree`)
- Q: When parsing Blade components with slots, should unnamed/default slot content be treated differently from named slots in the AST? ‚Üí A: Default slot is a special named slot with reserved name (e.g., "default" or "slot")
- Q: For error recovery scenarios (FR-026), what severity levels should errors have? ‚Üí A: Two levels: Error (syntax violations), Warning (deprecated syntax or best practice violations)
- Q: Should Livewire attributes (wire:click, wire:model, etc.) be supported? ‚Üí A: Yes, added Livewire support requirements (FR-044 through FR-051)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer building tooling for Laravel Blade templates (IDEs, linters, formatters, static analyzers), I need to parse Blade template files into a structured representation (AST) so that I can programmatically analyze, transform, or validate Blade syntax without executing PHP code.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a valid Blade template file with control structures (@if, @foreach), **When** the parser processes the file, **Then** it produces an AST with nodes representing each directive, their conditions/expressions, and nested content

2. **Given** a Blade template with component syntax (<x-alert type="error">), **When** the parser processes the file, **Then** the AST includes component nodes with attributes, slots, and child content properly structured

3. **Given** a Blade template with Alpine.js attributes (x-data, @click), **When** the parser processes the file, **Then** the AST preserves Alpine.js directives as distinct nodes separate from standard HTML attributes

8. **Given** a Blade template with Livewire attributes (wire:click, wire:model.live), **When** the parser processes the file, **Then** the AST preserves Livewire attributes with their modifiers and expressions as distinct nodes

4. **Given** a Blade template with syntax errors (unclosed @if, malformed echo), **When** the parser processes the file, **Then** it reports specific error messages with line and column numbers indicating the exact location of the problem

5. **Given** a large Blade template file (10,000+ lines), **When** the parser processes the file, **Then** it completes parsing in under 10 seconds and uses less than 100MB of memory

6. **Given** a parsed AST, **When** requested as JSON output, **Then** the entire tree structure is serializable to valid JSON with all node types, attributes, and relationships preserved

7. **Given** a Blade template via stdin or file path, **When** using the CLI interface, **Then** the parser outputs either JSON or human-readable tree format to stdout, with errors to stderr

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a Blade directive is unclosed (e.g., @if without @endif)? Parser continues parsing, produces partial AST with error marker at unclosed directive, reports Error with line/column location.
- How does the parser handle nested @verbatim blocks that contain Blade-like syntax? Content within @verbatim is treated as literal text, not parsed as Blade.
- What happens with malformed component syntax (e.g., missing closing tags)? Parser continues parsing, produces partial AST with error marker at malformed component, reports Error.
- How are deeply nested structures (10+ levels of @if/@foreach) handled? Parser processes up to 20 levels deep without significant performance degradation.
- What happens when Alpine.js shorthand syntax (@click) conflicts with Blade email obfuscation? Parser distinguishes based on context: @ within HTML attribute is Alpine.js, @ at line start is Blade directive.
- How does the parser handle mixed HTML, Blade, and Alpine.js in a single tag? All three are parsed and preserved in the AST with distinct node types.
- What happens when processing a file that is not valid UTF-8? Parser reports Error with encoding issue details.
- How does streaming/incremental parsing work with templates that have cross-section dependencies (@section/@yield)? In streaming mode, nodes are emitted as parsed; cross-section resolution deferred to consumer.

### Key Entities

- **Token**: Atomic lexical unit representing a piece of Blade syntax (directive keyword, echo delimiter, component tag, text content, expression, comment). Contains type, value, line, and column information.

- **AST Node**: Structured representation of a parsed Blade construct. Contains node type (directive, echo, component, HTML element, text, comment), children nodes, attributes, position information, and source text.

- **Directive Node**: AST node representing a Blade directive (@if, @foreach, etc.). Contains directive name, expression/condition (as unparsed string), opening/closing position, and child nodes.

- **Component Node**: AST node representing a Blade component (tag or directive syntax). Contains component name, attributes (key-value pairs), slots (named child sections including default slot with reserved name "default"), and content.

- **Echo Node**: AST node representing an echo statement. Contains echo type (escaped/unescaped), expression (as unparsed string), and position.

- **Error**: Representation of a parsing error. Contains error message, severity level (Error for syntax violations, Warning for deprecated syntax or best practice violations), line number, column number, and source context.

- **Parse Result**: Container for parsing output. Contains either a successful AST root node or a collection of errors/warnings. May contain both partial AST (with error markers at affected nodes) and the complete list of errors/warnings for error recovery scenarios.
