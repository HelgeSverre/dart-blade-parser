# Feature Specification: Complete HTML Element Parsing

**Feature Branch**: `003-implement-complete-html`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement complete HTML element parsing in the Blade parser. Currently, HTML tags like <div class="foo"> are incorrectly parsed as TextNode instead of proper HtmlElementNode instances. We need full HTML5-compliant parsing with Tag Recognition, Attribute Parsing, Nesting & Structure, Error Handling, Position Tracking, AST Structure, Performance constraints, and Implementation Requirements."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: HTML parsing, AST nodes, error handling, performance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No major ambiguities - feature is well-specified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: Parse HTML ‚Üí Generate AST ‚Üí Validate structure
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement mapped to specific parsing capability
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí HtmlElementNode, AttributeNode types, Token types
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All requirements testable and measurable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Developers writing Blade templates need the parser to correctly recognize HTML elements as structured nodes rather than plain text. When they write `<div class="foo">content</div>`, the parser should understand this as an HTML element with attributes and children, enabling tools to provide accurate syntax highlighting, code completion, refactoring, and static analysis.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a simple HTML element `<div class="foo">text</div>`, **When** the parser processes it, **Then** it generates an HtmlElementNode with tagName 'div', one attribute 'class' with value 'foo', and one TextNode child containing 'text'

2. **Given** a void element `<br>` without closing tag, **When** the parser processes it, **Then** it generates an HtmlElementNode marked as void with no children

3. **Given** a self-closing element `<div />`, **When** the parser processes it, **Then** it generates an HtmlElementNode marked as self-closing with no children

4. **Given** nested HTML `<div><p>text</p></div>`, **When** the parser processes it, **Then** it generates an HtmlElementNode 'div' containing an HtmlElementNode 'p' containing a TextNode

5. **Given** HTML with Alpine.js attributes `<div x-data="{count: 0}" @click="count++">`, **When** the parser processes it, **Then** it recognizes and categorizes Alpine.js attributes separately from standard attributes

6. **Given** HTML with Livewire attributes `<button wire:click="save" wire:loading.attr="disabled">`, **When** the parser processes it, **Then** it recognizes and categorizes Livewire attributes with their modifiers

7. **Given** mixed Blade and HTML `<div>@if($show)<p>{{$text}}</p>@endif</div>`, **When** the parser processes it, **Then** it generates an HtmlElementNode containing Blade directive nodes and HTML element nodes in correct order

8. **Given** boolean attributes `<input disabled required>`, **When** the parser processes it, **Then** it recognizes attributes without values as boolean attributes

9. **Given** mismatched tags `<div></span>`, **When** the parser processes it, **Then** it generates an error "Expected </div>, found </span>" and returns a partial AST

10. **Given** an unclosed tag `<div><p>`, **When** the parser processes it, **Then** it generates an error "Unclosed <p> at line X" and returns a partial AST

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a void element has a closing tag (e.g., `<br></br>`)? ‚Üí System reports error "Void element <br> cannot have closing tag"
- What happens when attribute values contain quotes that need escaping? ‚Üí System correctly parses escaped quotes in attribute values
- What happens when deeply nested HTML exceeds typical nesting depth? ‚Üí System maintains correct parent-child relationships without depth limits
- What happens when tag names are invalid (e.g., `<123>`)? ‚Üí System reports error "Invalid tag name: 123"
- What happens when multiple parsing errors occur in one template? ‚Üí System reports all errors, not just the first one
- How does the system distinguish between `<div>` (HTML) and `<x-component>` (Blade component)? ‚Üí Tags starting with 'x-' followed by hyphen are Blade components, others are HTML
- What happens when attributes use different quote styles? ‚Üí System accepts both single and double quotes, and unquoted values where valid

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Tag Recognition**
- **FR-001**: System MUST recognize all standard HTML5 elements including div, p, span, h1-h6, ul, ol, li, table, tr, td, th, thead, tbody, form, input, button, select, textarea, a, img, video, audio, canvas, svg
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify void elements (area, base, br, col, embed, hr, img, input, link, meta, param, source, track, wbr) that cannot have children
- **FR-003**: System MUST support self-closing syntax for all elements (e.g., `<div />`, `<Component />`)
- **FR-004**: System MUST distinguish between HTML elements (e.g., `<div>`) and Blade components (e.g., `<x-component>`)

**Attribute Parsing**

**Performance**

**Compatibility**
- **FR-036**: System MUST work on all Dart target platforms: Flutter, CLI, and web
- **FR-037**: System MUST use only pure Dart standard library with zero external parsing dependencies
- **FR-038**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility: all existing tests (100+) for Blade directives MUST continue passing

### Key Entities

- **HtmlElementNode**: Represents a parsed HTML element in the AST. Contains tag name (string), attributes (map of attribute name to AttributeNode), children (list of AST nodes), flags indicating if self-closing or void, and position information (start and end locations in source)

- **AttributeNode**: Base representation of an HTML attribute. Specialized into:
  - **StandardAttribute**: Regular HTML attributes (class, id, style, data-*, aria-*)
  - **AlpineAttribute**: Alpine.js framework attributes (x-data, x-show, @click, :class)
  - **LivewireAttribute**: Livewire framework attributes (wire:click, wire:model with modifiers)

- **Token Types** (for lexer): Represents different HTML syntactic elements during tokenization:
  - Opening tag start delimiter (`<`)
  - Closing tag start delimiter (`</`)
  - Tag end delimiter (`>`)
  - Self-closing delimiter (`/>`)
  - Tag name (sequence of valid characters)
  - Attribute name and value pairs

- **Position**: Represents location in source template. Contains line number, column number, and byte offset to enable precise error messages and source mapping
