# Coverage Setup - Complete! âœ…

## What Was Installed

### 1. **justfile** - Modern Task Runner
A `justfile` has been created with comprehensive coverage commands. This is a modern alternative to Makefiles with better syntax and cross-platform support.

### 2. **coverage package** - Dart Coverage Tools
Added `coverage: ^1.15.0` to `dev_dependencies` in `pubspec.yaml`.

### 3. **COVERAGE.md** - Complete Documentation
Comprehensive guide covering usage, CI/CD integration, and troubleshooting.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Show all available commands
just

# Generate coverage and show summary
just coverage-summary

# Generate HTML report and open in browser
just coverage-html

# Check if coverage meets 90% threshold
just coverage-check 90
```

## Current Coverage Stats

- **Line Coverage: 78.5%** (1348 of 1718 lines)
- **Source Files: 11**
- **Target: 90%+**

## Why `just` Instead of `make`?

### Modern Alternative Benefits:
1. **Better syntax** - No confusing tabs vs spaces
2. **Cross-platform** - Works on macOS, Linux, Windows
3. **User-friendly** - Built-in help with `just --list`
4. **Maintained** - Active development, modern features
5. **Fast** - Written in Rust, very performant

### Traditional Make Comparison:

**Makefile** (old approach):
```makefile
.PHONY: coverage
coverage:
	@echo "Running tests..."
	@dart test --coverage=coverage
	@dart run coverage:format_coverage --lcov --in=coverage --out=coverage/lcov.info --report-on=lib
```

**justfile** (modern approach):
```just
# Generate code coverage report (lcov format)
coverage:
    @echo "ðŸ§ª Running tests with coverage..."
    @dart test --coverage=coverage || true
    @echo "ðŸ“Š Formatting coverage data..."
    @dart run coverage:format_coverage --lcov --in=coverage --out=coverage/lcov.info --report-on=lib
    @echo "âœ… Coverage report generated: coverage/lcov.info"
```

Key differences:
- No `.PHONY` needed
- No tab requirements
- Emoji support âœ¨
- Built-in command descriptions
- Error handling with `|| true`

## All Available Commands

### Testing
- `just test` - Run all tests
- `just test-verbose` - Run with expanded output
- `just test-file FILE` - Run specific test
- `just test-name NAME` - Run tests matching pattern

### Coverage
- `just coverage` - Generate lcov report
- `just coverage-summary` - Show summary
- `just coverage-html` - Generate & open HTML report
- `just coverage-clean` - Filter generated files
- `just coverage-check THRESHOLD` - Validate minimum coverage
- `just coverage-clean-artifacts` - Remove coverage files

### Code Quality
- `just lint` - Run analyzer
- `just fix` - Apply auto-fixes
- `just format` - Format code
- `just format-check` - Check formatting (CI)
- `just check` - Run all checks

### Benchmarks
- `just bench` - Run all benchmarks
- `just bench-file FILE` - Run specific benchmark

### Maintenance
- `just clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `just deps` - Get dependencies
- `just deps-upgrade` - Upgrade dependencies
- `just deps-outdated` - Show outdated packages
- `just publish-check` - Dry-run publish

### CI/CD
- `just ci` - Full CI pipeline locally

## What Was Updated

### `.gitignore`
```gitignore
# Coverage
coverage/
*.lcov
```

### `pubspec.yaml`
```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  coverage: ^1.15.0  # Added
  lints: ^6.0.0
  test: ^1.25.0
```

## Example Workflows

### Local Development
```bash
# Make changes
vim lib/src/lexer/lexer.dart

# Run tests
just test

# Check coverage impact
just coverage-summary

# View detailed report
just coverage-html
```

### Pre-Commit Check
```bash
# Run full quality check
just check

# Ensure coverage meets threshold
just coverage-check 75
```

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Install just
  run: cargo install just

- name: Run CI pipeline
  run: just ci

- name: Check coverage
  run: just coverage-check 80
```

## Troubleshooting

### `just: command not found`
Install just:
```bash
# macOS
brew install just

# Linux
cargo install just

# Or download binary from https://github.com/casey/just/releases
```

### Coverage not generating
Ensure coverage package is installed:
```bash
dart pub get
```

### HTML won't open
Manually open:
```bash
open coverage/html/index.html  # macOS
xdg-open coverage/html/index.html  # Linux
```

## Next Steps

1. **Improve coverage** - Target 90%+ (currently 78.5%)
2. **Add coverage badge** - Use Codecov or Coveralls
3. **Set up CI** - Add coverage checks to GitHub Actions
4. **Monitor trends** - Track coverage over time
