# Next Steps - Project Roadmap

**Current State:** v1.0.1 ready, 99.6% test coverage, 40 uncommitted files  
**Date:** 2025-10-10

---

## 🎯 Immediate Actions (Next 30 min)

### Option 1: Commit & Ship 🚀 (Recommended)
**Goal:** Get v1.0.1 released cleanly

1. **Review and commit changes** (15 min)
   ```bash
   git status
   git add lib/ test/
   git commit -m "fix: empty tag validation and code cleanup for v1.0.1"
   
   git add CHANGELOG.md pubspec.yaml
   git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.0.1"
   
   git add CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md COMPLETION_REPORT.md IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
   git commit -m "docs: add completion reports and status"
   ```

2. **Tag the release** (2 min)
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Release v1.0.1: Bug fixes and code cleanup"
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

3. **Publish to pub.dev** (optional, 10 min)
   - Review pubspec.yaml (repository URL, description)
   - Run `dart pub publish --dry-run`
   - If ready: `dart pub publish`

**Impact:** Clean release, professional git history

---

### Option 2: Polish More ✨ (30-60 min)
**Goal:** Reduce warnings further before release

1. **Fix type inference warnings** (30 min)
   - 6 instances of `Future.delayed` needing `Future<void>.delayed`
   - 2 instances of `asFuture` needing `asFuture<void>()`
   - All in examples/ - low priority but easy to fix

2. **Handle print statements** (15 min)
   - Add `// ignore: avoid_print` to examples (acceptable for demos)
   - Or add analysis_options override for examples/

3. **Final analyze check** (5 min)
   - Reduce warnings from 513 to ~480
   - Run tests one more time

**Impact:** Warnings drop to ~480, very clean codebase

---

### Option 3: Add More Tests 🧪 (1-2 hours)
**Goal:** Push test coverage even higher

1. **Security tests** (from IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md)
   - XSS in echo statements
   - Path traversal in @include
   - DOS with deeply nested structures
   - ~15 new tests

2. **Malformed input tests**
   - Unclosed echo, unclosed comments
   - Invalid directive names
   - Nested echo edge cases
   - ~12 new tests

3. **Real-world templates**
   - Jetstream auth views
   - Breeze components
   - ~10 new tests

**Impact:** 560+ total tests, 99.7%+ coverage, bullet-proof parser

## 🎲 Decision Matrix

### If you want to...

**Ship quickly and professionally:**
→ **Choose Option 1** (Commit & Ship)
- Time: 30 min
- Impact: Clean v1.0.1 release
- Risk: Low

**Have an ultra-polished codebase:**
→ **Choose Option 2** (Polish More)
- Time: 60 min
- Impact: 480 warnings (down from 513)
- Risk: Very low

**Maximize quality and robustness:**
→ **Choose Option 3** (Add More Tests)
- Time: 2 hours
- Impact: 560+ tests, 99.8% coverage
- Risk: Low, high value

**Balanced approach:**
→ **Do Option 1 today, Option 2 tomorrow, Option 3 this week**
- Best of all worlds
- Steady progress
- Professional cadence

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Immediate (Today):**
1. ✅ **Commit changes** - Don't lose the great work we did
2. ✅ **Tag v1.0.1** - Mark this milestone
3. ⚠️ **Review for publish** - Check if ready for pub.dev

**This Week:**
4. Fix type warnings (30 min easy win)
5. Add security tests (2 hours high value)

**Next Week:**
6. Add malformed input tests
7. Consider v1.1.0 with expanded test suite
